Summary: We finally have a date for the first Alpha Pi-Fest!

It's on!

On Sunday the 9/6/2013 we're going to dedicate 5 hours of hacking on the Raspberry Pi!

Here's a moderated version of the meeting request sent:

<i><p>Welcome to the first e-v-e-r Pi-Fest!

We're getting together for a Raspberry Pi hackathon.

For those of you who never heard of it, the Raspberry Pi is a small board, running Linux, with GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins you can hook up to a vast number of electronic gadgets.
See more at : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi

Even if you don't own a Raspberry Pi, you are more than welcome to join us at the hackathon.


So basically, this geekalicous evening is relevant for you if you can be classified in any one of these Pi-Tiers™:

* "WTF is it?"
* "It's shiny I want one"
* "Bought one, turned it on once"
* "OMG I MADE A LED BLINK"
* "GPIO Bozz"
* "Pi-Master"

PLEASE NOTE: We won't be soldering anything at the office, as that will probably not pass the "Workplace Safety Rules"..

The tentative schedule for now is:

18:00 - 18:15 Social Mingling and Typical Israeli "Being Late is fashionable"™

18:15 - 18:30 Present Ideas and divide into teams

18:30 - 20:30 HACK HACK HACK  (a-thon)

20:30 - 21:00 Present projects' status

21:00 - 21:30 10bis Pizzas (FTW) and window for anyone that needs to leave early to depart

21:30 - 22:30 HACK

22:30 - 23:00 Show (hopefully) finished projects
