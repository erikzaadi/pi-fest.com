Summary: The idea of Pi-Fest started...

After having a cake baking contest at our work (IBM XIV), A couple of Raspberry Pi tinkerers had this idea of doing the same meeting, just with the Raspberry Pi instead of, well, real pies.

We thought it would be awesome if we get together to hack a bit, trying to collaborate on some Raspberry Pi hack.

We set up this site, and started rolling an internal hackathon, initially in our own company.

If it will be successfull, we will try to launch it at another location.

BTW, We are desperatly looking for some IT enabled space, if you can think of any place that will host us for free, please let us know..
