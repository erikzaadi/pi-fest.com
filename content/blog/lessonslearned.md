After doing the first Alpha Pi-Fest, we got together to try to learn how we could improve the Pi-Fest experience.
Here's some of the thinks we thought of:

1.  Standartize

    Make sure everyone bringing a Raspberry Pi has the latest python GPIO lib

    Each Pi should have a unique hostname, saves lot's of NSLOOKUP time

    Preferably ipython and tmux installed as well

1.  Do an introduction for newbies

1.  Ensure each group has a mentor

1.  Make a sorted inventory and be sure to have plenty of parts, especially:

    * Breadboards
    * LEDs
    * Connector Cables

1.  Keep only the first part of the meeting scheduled and structured

    People came to hack
    
    Although the introduction is important, it's critical to not limit the groups to a certain mission or task (after the introduction)
    
    Their own creativity will be much more fruitful

1.  Socialize

    * Have designated coffee / snack breaks to get people to talk to each other and breathe
    * Have at least one big food break
    * Have booze

1.  Don't set the meeting to late

    We scheduled the Pi-Fest between 18:00 and 23:00

    We only lasted until 22:30 because people were to tired
