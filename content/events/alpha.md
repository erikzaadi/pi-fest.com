We've had the first e-v-e-r Pi-Fest meeting!

This meeting took place on Sunday the 9/6/2013, and was internal at our company (IBM XIV).

Our equipment included:

* 5 Raspberry Pi's
* 2 Breadboards
* 3 DC Motors
* Lot's of LEDs
* Lot's of buttons
* One real Pie

We got together 11 people (two left after 30 mins, they were to hip).

We started off with dividing into 3 groups, and the initial task was (how surprising), to blink a LED.

During the first task, we took the opportunity to explain to newcomers about the Raspberry Pi.

We then expanded the first task to blink two LEDs, and then to use buttons to process input from the GPIO.

Finally we added to the task to use the PWN module to blink and dim LEDs.

We did a short interrupt brake to see the status of all the teams, during which we had real Pie (FTW):

After the break, we went back to the group, and each group set out on a mission (!) to do something a bit more complicated.

One group started working on connecting a DC motor:

Another group on running a LED matrix:

Meanwhile, we ordered Pizzas, and when they finally came (yes we were hungry) we ate:

With our bellies full, we continued hacking on:

And then came the highlight of the evening, a DC motor singing [Little Jonathan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A4nschen_klein)

That's all for this time folks!
